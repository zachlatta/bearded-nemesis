Getting Our Hands Dirty
=======================

Now that we (finally) have the fundamentals of programming down, let's set up our environment and get our hands dirty.

The JDK
-------

The JDK, or Java development kit, is a complete Java runtime environment bundled with tools for developing, debugging, and monitoring Java applications. We'll need to download and install it on our computer.

Go to [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and download the latest JDK for your platform. Run and click through the installer until you have it installed.


Integrated Development Environments
-----------------------------------

Java is an integrated development environment language, which means it was made to be programmed with IDEs. An **integrated development environment** is a suite of tools bundled into a single application used for programming. IDEs normally consist of a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger.

The three most popular Java IDEs are IntelliJ, Eclipse, and Netbeans. We'll go over how to set up IntelliJ on a Mac in the following section. Hopefully you'll be able to figure it out if you're on a different OS.

## IntelliJ

IntelliJ is a popular IDE developed by Jetbrains. Head over to [https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and download the latest version of either the ultimate or community edition. I recommend you start with the community edition.
